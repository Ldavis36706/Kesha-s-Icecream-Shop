<h2>Summary of Application</h2>

For this project, I imagined that I was the proud owner of an ice cream shop.  As an entrepreneur, I know that increased efficiency can be the thing that sets you apart from competition. I used my knowledge about iterables, data types, conditionals, and user input, to build the logic for an application that can automatically take customer orders.

To complete the order I just need to know if you prefer a cup or a cone, how many scoops of icecream you'd like, and the flavor. I went a step further and I can also randomly choose a flavor for you as well if you'd like. Enjoy!!!
